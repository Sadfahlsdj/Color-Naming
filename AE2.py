"""
TODO
most rgb values have duplicates, for each rgb value find the most common prediction 
for it, and use that value in the dataset; the dataset should only have one of
each rgb value - DONE

for the centroids of the colors (part 2) (use original dataset for this):
for each color, average out every set of rgb values that was predicted to be 
that color, and treat the resulting mean as the centroid
then for each color that is predicted, take the euclidean distance between
the input rgb, and the centroid rgb of that color
